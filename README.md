    <h2>About Erebus Marketplace Script</h2>
</div>

<div align="center">
**Erebus Marketplace Script** is a modern, privacy-focused marketplace platform built with **PHP 8.3** and **Laravel 12.11.1**. Erebus Marketplace Script is a rewritten version of the lost Kabus Marketplace Script and provides a complete marketplace solution for anonymous commerce using Monero.
  
  The purpose of creating Erebus Marketplace Script is to replace Kabus Marketplace Script and to provide safe and anonymous commerce software and ensure continued evolution of privacy-respecting marketplace technology. It is not created for any illegal purpose, nor does it encourage such activities. The platform facilitates the sale of legal products such as legally aquired electronics and jewlery online as anonymously and securely as possible.

Built with a security-first approach, including hardened Laravel controllers, maximum CSP policies, and zero-JavaScript architecture for optimal Tor compatibility.
